# TractionNeckBrace
Contains all the MATLAB and the simulation files I developed for simulating the initial prototype of the 2RPS - 1 PRS Traction Neck Brace. 

The initial project involved a research of the numerical solution of the forward/ inverse kinematics of the 2RPS - 1PRS parallel platform. 
Various parallel platforms such as 2PRU - 1PRS, 3PRS, 3RPS parallel platforms were analyzed and their kinematic equations were analyzed. 

## kin.m
Contains a version of the analytical kinematics solution for the 2RPS -1PRS parallel platform where I developed the vector matrices
in each limb and analyzed the kinematics.

## limbkin.m
Contains the vector formulas and the kinematic equations for the 2PRU - 1PRS parallel actuated platform. 

## limbkin3PRS.m
Analytic solution for the 3PRS parallel actuated platform. 

## limbkinRPS.m
Contains a derivation of the kinematics for 3RPS ankle rehabilitation device where the closed form solutions are derived using a quaternion approach.
